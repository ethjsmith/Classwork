    <p class="pa">&nbsp; Old School RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) 
        developed and published by Jagex. The game was released on 22 February 2013. When Old School RuneScape launched, it was originally an August 2007 
        version of RuneScape, which was highly popular prior to the launch of RuneScape 3. The game has since received engine improvements, new content, and 
        quality of life updates largely decided by in-game polls. Despite having a smaller development team and a slower relative update schedule, Old School 
        RuneScape has a larger player-base than RuneScape </p><br>

      Old School RuneScape is an MMORPG with adventure elements. It features a persistent world in which players can interact with each 
      other and the environment. The basic mechanics are largely the same as RuneScape on 10 August 2007. The player controls a single character and 
      can interact with NPCs, objects, and entities in the game world by left-clicking, or selecting an option from the object's right-click menu, since 
      many objects can offer more than one interaction option. Users can gain experience points (exp.) and level up individual skills, making their playable 
      character more powerful or more capable of using that skill. There is a large selection of skills, grouped mainly between three different categories: 
      combat, gathering, and artisan. Combat skills aid the player in defeating enemy monsters or other players, with skills such as strength, range, 
      and magic, among others. The gathering skills, such as mining, fishing, and woodcutting allow the player to gather in game resources. The artisan 
      skills include skills such as cooking, crafting, and smithing. The input mechanics are mainly point-and-click, and combat is turn-based. </p>

    Old School RuneScape largely takes place in the fictional realm of Gielinor, a planet filled with multiple environments and climates. 
    It is divided into kingdoms and is inhabited by humans, vampyres, elves, monkeys, dwarves, fairies, gnomes, goblins, trolls, ogres and other races.
    Gielinor's basic history is told in five Ages. Guthix, the god of balance and nature, shaped Gielnor in the First Age. In the Second Age, 
    Guthix disappeared and the mortal Zamorak apotheosised into the god of chaos. In the Third Age, Zamorak waged war against Guthix and Saradomin, 
    the god of order and wisdom, until they reached an armistice. In the Fourth Age, mortal races fought and competed until human mages discovered how 
    to create runestones. By the Fifth Age, humans became the dominant race. </p><br>
