#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //1. Declare a c string
    char cs[] = "Bob";
    //2. Declare a standard library string
    string s = "not bob";
    //What's the difference?
	
    //3. display the 3rd character on each string. 

    //4. Use index on a string
	
    //5. Test out cin. 
    
    //6. Get the size of each 
    //Change the size of s and re-run
    
    //7. test out assignment and equivalence
    //Is it using memory locations or contents?
    
    //When would you use C-Strings?
    //How can you tell the difference?
}
