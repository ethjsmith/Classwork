# particleGeneration
repo holding code used to generate a particle system, for a CS3000 project.

when I had more than 3 files that I was constantly changing on my laptop and my desktop I decided to put in on github instead.

# TODO

main requirements
* [x] draw particles
* [x] give them vector movement
