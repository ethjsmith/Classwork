  <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
  <p>I don't really have a lot to put in here but I suppose that I can show a picture of my earliest, and most certainly worst page.</p>

<div id="How I've Progressed">
    <p>Honestly I had no idea what I was doing when I came into this class, I no idea what building a website even meant, I thought it was an easy two step process, obviously not. I've earned a lot through this class but going back and looking at the following monstrosity always makes me both laugh and die a little on the inside.</p>
    <image src="img/Capture.JPG" style=" width: 300px; height: 200px;"></image>
    <P>However, seeing my progress, especially what I managed to do on the Midterm, always makes me happier because it shows that I actually progressed, yes, it isn't much better than the other one, I forgot how to link the CSS file, but its actually organized and for the most part its set up properly.</P>

    <button onclick="firstfunction()">Click me to find out how much I know I messed up on the mid term then look at the first button and watch some totally unintentional magic</button>
        <p id="funish"></p>

        <script>
            function firstfunction() {
                document.getElementById("funish").innerHTML = "I fully expected to get an F";
            }
        </script>
