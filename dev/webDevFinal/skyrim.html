        <div id="Great Things about Skyrim">
            <p>Skyrim is an incredible game with so many overarching stories that trying to piece complete it all is nearly impossible. I have personally put over 250 hours into the game due to it's numerous quests that drag all over the game, and this isn't even including the additional quests adding by the massive modding community. One of the best parts of the game is the number of unique characters that will be encountered while playing the game, combine those with hundreds of randomized events, and you have a game that allows for hundreds of hours of non-repetetive gameplay.</p>

        <div id="Terrible things about Skyrim">
            <p>Skyrim can get boring at times and here's why</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There aren't enough voice actors for all the characters, and what I mean by this, is that there are very few voice actors for about 80 unique characters which can hurt the immersion</li>
                    <li>Without mods, the game can look downright hideous, the legendary edition came about just a few years ago and even then it would bad compared to 2010 to 2015 standards</li>
                    <li>It can get repetitive, this is something that can be fixed with mods but a big issue that I've noticed is that the combat gets boring really fast if you don't change up your weapons every few hours</li>
                    <li>Sometimes, the mods can literally break the game and you have to remove them through Bethesda's website</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me and you shall know the rating!</button>
        <p id="fun"></p>

        <script>
            function myFunction() {
                document.getElementById("fun").innerHTML = "The Final Rating is: 7/10!";
            }
        </script>
    </main>
