This midterm will be done as a Take Home Project. It should be completed on your own.

For this project you will be creating a website for a new Store (not previously used) and providing navigation to those pages. You can be a store that sales whatever product/service you would like. Please ensure your pages include the following:

Create a new RESPONSIVE  web page for a Store (NOT from an existing site).
Design your page for a Tablet or a Desktop Device (use appropriate Media Query and Viewport.
Must have 2 pages with content. The pages should link back to the HOME page as well as to the other pages.
Pull in a font family from https://fonts.google.com/ (Links to an external site.).
Create a style rule to display the navigation list items as a single horizontal line.
Each page MUST include a picture with appropriate wrapping (float).
Use <div> tags at least once and style it so that it is different than the rest of the page.
Use class = at least once and style it uniquely.
Appropriately use the article tag or the aside tag on one of your pages
One of your pages needs to include a table which will organize information so that it is easier to read. (i.e. Pricing sheet).
Use at 2 dynamic pseudo-classes in your desktop media query.
Use a gradient.
Add a favicon to your site.
LOOKS COUNT! Create a NEW style sheet to give your pages a cohesive, (all pages MUST have information on them and a css file linked to it) updated look and a professional feel that includes:
fonts
colors
positioning (pictures etc.)
anything else you would like to do
After you have completed the steps above, browse your products and make sure all of your links work correctly. Once you are satisfied with the functionality of your site, validate and zip ALL necessary files and upload the zip file here.
