          <h2>Q and A </h2><br>
          What is spotify?<br>
          Here's a video explaining it <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8L5ySUufdE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <br><br>how is logging in handled? you login through the spotify API, so I don't handle your credentials at all, which is neat, although it makes incliding a database harder... <br><br>
          why was this site made? Because I don't really like spotify's random playlist algorithms, and wanted to try my hand at making my own, which gave me what I wanted, or at least to try to. <br><br>
          <br><br> How will you include an HTML canvas element in this project?
          <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">Your browser does not support the HTML canvas tag.</canvas>
          <script>
            var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
            var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
            ctx.font = "30px Arial";
            ctx.fillText("Like this :)", 10, 50);
          </script>
        </div>
        {% endblock %}
