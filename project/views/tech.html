Technologies Used
<p>
HTML/XHTML<br>
The main elements of the site are written in HTML<br>
</p>
<p>
Canvas Element<br>
On the about page, there is a canvas element, with some self-referrential text inside it.<br>
</p>
<p>
Video Element<br>
<br>
On the about page, there is a video element explaining what spotify is. it is actually an embedded youtube video.</p>
<p>
CSS<br>
On every page there is CSS styling. you can see it in the nav bar, and the green side pannels, unless I change those last minute... <br>
</p>
<p>
javascript<br>
There is a javascript function on the about page that changes the color of one of the divs. There is lots of javascript on the backend, as it is written in nodejs<br>
</p>
<p>
dynamic javascript<br>
This is the same function on the about page that changes the color of the div... <br>
</p>
<p>
PHP<br>
the about page is written with some PHP to display the navbar. it is the only page with PHP, as for the rest I used nodejs on the serverside. <br>
</p>
<p>
Database<br>
Database connected to the about page, at the bottom, allows you to add comments/ or feedback on the site... whatever you want to add really. <br>
</p>
<p>
SVG logo<br>
There is an SVG logo for the site in the top left, and a smalled version on the about page. I don't think it looks very good, but it is a vector graphic.<br>
</p>
<p>
webserver<br>
The server is hosted by a nodejs instance which serves up all the code. it has methods for every page, as well as lots of functionality for interacting with the spotify api <br>
</p>
<p>
validation <br>
The pages(templates) are validated :) Content generated by the spotify api calls may not be. <br>
</p>
