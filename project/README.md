This folder contains files for the main project...

or it will haha


an app that creates better spotify playlists I think would be cool

specifically, here's how it would meet all the requirements


Here are the technologies/objectives I expect to be included in your project:

XHTML
HTML5
HTML5 Canvas element
HTML5 Video element
CSS
JavaScript
Dynamic JavaScript
PHP
Database
SVG Logo
A webserver
XHTML validation for all pages
A Technologies Used page that explains how you used each of these items on your website
Other things I haven't thought of yet, but we will cover
In addition to existing objectives you must meet all of the following quality objectives:

Quality Objectives:

Neat, organized, syntactically correct html, and clean code
Submission is overall functional
Interface is neat and visually appealing

haha what


sitemap  ? ::

homepage that explains what the website is ?
login page < ? > I think this is temp, I will not be using it ?
register page <?> I think this will redirect to spotify, not to my account ?

honestly? I don't really think I need user authentication, it kind of goes against the point of this site  ? and if I'm being real, I don't need a database either lmfao what is this

playlist creator page -> is there multiple of these ? I don't think so

your created(saved?) pages/playlists <?> this would probably link to user and stuff

about <?> this is where I'd stick a video LOL
